         ENG 502 C - Writing Seminar: Fiction  - Sarah Anderson  Grd: A
         _________________________________________________________________
          
         In this Short Fiction Elective, students spent the term
         discussing and analyzing the way a short story is made and how
         it impacts its audience. They did this by reading and writing
         stories. Always reading from the perspective of writers, they
         focused their discussions around craft elements that make up a
         story. They participated in full-class discussions, full-class
         workshops, peer editing, and almost daily writing prompts.
         During the course of the term, they wrote two short analytical
         essays focusing on a specific craft device (such as repetition,
         point-of-view, character development, sentence structure, etc.)
         and three original short stories - one piece of flash fiction,
         and two longer stories. By sharing with each other constructive
         and critical feedback, along with positive reinforcement, they
         became an effective and supportive community of writers.
          
         Alec impressed me this term. He was positive, motivated and
         completely dedicated to the writing process. He was a
         self-advocate, setting up conferences or taking a moment to ask
         for some feedback on a story or an idea. He was also vocal (with
         me and with his peers) about wanting to improve his writing. He
         understood that subtle, nuanced changes can dramatically affect
         the course of a story. Alec was also a leader at the harkness
         table. He was not afraid to speak his mind and give honest
         advice to his peers. He was also not afraid to argue a point and
         always did so respectfully. In a recent self-reflection, Alec
         wrote this: "This is the best my writing has ever been. Period.
         I think that that is because of a mixture of things. I have more
         time to focus on English because I've already sorted out my
         college situation. Writing short stories has allowed me to focus
         on the purpose behind every sentence, something that I can't
         really do with longer pieces. Reading from a wide variety of
         texts has given me new ideas for how to write stories.
         Additionally, observing master storytellers has inspired me with
         new techniques." I am so glad Alec felt this way about his
         writing because I felt the same way. I hope he will keep
         writing! Alec has been a pleasure to teach and I wish him all
         the best as he moves through the rest of the school year and
         beyond.
          
          
 
         MAT 420 BU - Calculus * - Stephanie Girard  Grd: B+
         _________________________________________________________________
          
              Math 420 marks the beginning of the study of Differential
         Calculus.  In this course, many functions and their derivatives
         are investigated via algebraic, graphic and numeric approaches,
         and several applications of differentiation are explored, namely
         how derivatives can be used to determine the graph of an unknown
         function, to find the optimal value of a given expression and to
         compare various rates of change.
         Alec was a very active member of this small, fun-loving group.
         It was clear, very early on in the term, how much these nine
         students enjoyed each other's company and how much they were
         invested in helping each other understand the material of Math
         420.  Alec presented his fair share of homework problems to the
         class, fielded questions from his classmates with ease and good

         humor and asked thoughtful questions of them and me whenever he
         needed clarification on a particular problem or concept.  He was
         fully engaged in the give-and-take of class discussions and was
         helpful to those around him during group work at the board,
         sharing ideas, working collaboratively.  Alec found some of the
         material this fall quite challenging, but he responded to his
         difficulties appropriately by seeking me out for extra help.  A
         solid showing on the final test indicates that he has pulled
         many of these ideas together, in the end.
         I have enjoyed working with Alec this fall and wish him the best
         in his final two terms here at PEA.
          
 
         CHI 502 A - Modern Chinese Lang & Lit - Ting Yuan  Grd: B+
         _________________________________________________________________
          
         This term we covered three chapters from the textbook Chaoyue
         Advancing in Chinese and did a supplementary reading by Chinese
         writer Dishan Xu from Masterworks Chinese Companion.  In this
         class students continue to expand their vocabulary, to learn
         more advanced sentence structures, to deepen their understanding
         of Chinese culture, and to enhance their oral and written
         proficiency through class discussions and writing essays.
         Performance in vocabulary quizzes and tests, essays, debates,
         class preparation and participation form the basis for grading.
         Their efforts, attitude, and the progress they have made
         throughout the term are also taken into consideration.
          
         It was my great pleasure to teach Alec again.  He has been a
         valuable member of the class throughout the term and his
         positive energy often cheered the whole class up.  His good
         sense of humor made him well liked by his classmates.  I could
         always count on him to be an active participant.  He made
         insightful comments, asked thoughtful questions, and helped move
         the discussion towards a better understanding of the materials.
         He showed respect for his classmates and defended his positions
         in a nice way.  Even though his oral skill is stronger than his
         writing, he has made good progress in his written work this
         term.  He would perform at an even more impressive level if he
         could be consistently conscientious in his daily class
         preparation and his study for vocabulary quizzes.  Overall Alec
         did a great job this term.  Keep up the good work!  I look
         forward to teaching him again and wish him the best for his
         future studies.
          
 
         BIO 490 FX - Introductory Genetics * - Anne Rankin  Grd: B+
         _________________________________________________________________
          
         I really enjoyed getting to know Alec this fall in Genetics.  It
         was clear to me early in the fall how much he loves Biology and
         what a strong foundation he has in the subject from taking
         Advanced Biology last year.  This elective is designed to fill
         in gaps from that curriculum and develop more deeply areas which
         were covered superficially.  It seemed to take Alec several
         weeks to realize this and to adjust his approach to my
         expectations.  This process was probably not made easier by the
         several days that he missed early in the term for college
         visits.  Alec's work improved a great deal during the second
         half of the term.  This seemed to boost his confidence and his

         engagement during class discussions.  He became much more
         playful and willing to take risks with his classmates.  The
         final project he worked on with a partner seems to illustrate
         perfectly his wonderful blend of serious student and playful
         teenager.    They wrote an extension assignment off the last lab
         we did this fall.  They managed to produce a rigorous assignment
         presented in a humorous, conversational style which I think
         students will really enjoy.  If he has not yet shown you this
         assignment, you should ask to see it.  I hope Alec is proud of
         his work in Genetics this term and that he has a great last two
         terms at Exeter.
          
          
          
 
         REL 460 D - Ethics of the Marketplace - Kathy Brownback  Grd: A-
         _________________________________________________________________
          
         In addition to the study of many specific cases in which
         companies have confronted ethical dilemmas over the past few
         decades, the Ethics of the Marketplace class analyzed several
         recent documentary films including ABC's The Milgram Experiment
         Revisited and Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room. We
         considered perspectives on the market ranging from
         libertarianism to the stakeholder model, or the narrow vs. the
         broad view of responsibility. We also looked at the issue of
         income inequality that has recently been at the forefront of
         U.S. and global news, reading  several  chapters from Barbara
         Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America
         alongside rival views of this issue by Milton Friedman and
         Martin Feldstein. Throughout the term we asked how particular
         problems should be addressed (if at all)-by business, by
         consumers, by governments (U.S. or foreign), or by other
         organizations devoted to one social issue or another. For the
         last two weeks of the term, the students chose individual
         projects on topics of interest, preparing the class for the
         discussion and presenting their own research.
          
         Alex was a strong student in the class, partly because he had
         done previous study but primarily because he tackled the issues
         we considered with insight and passion. At times, as he and I
         discussed on several occasions, he needs to throttle back and
         let others speak-his eagerness to carry the day with his own
         ideas can get in the way. But he thinks well on his feet and
         enjoys debate, and welcomes challenge from others in the group.
         His written work was generally at the B+ or A- level, needing
         additional context and depth in ways I have indicated on his
         papers. His last project was his best--an excellent presentation
         on the topic of a pneumonia drug donation rejected by a
         nonprofit in favor of lower pricing across the board. Alex
         presented the case well and led us in a great discussion of this
         non-obvious dilemma. It was great to have him in the class.
          
 
         MUS 010 N31 - Private Lessons - Piano - Jonathan Sakata  Grd: P
         _________________________________________________________________
          
         Alec, enjoyed tremendously your creative work this term: how you
         bring the force of the imaginary, the real, the (un)known, the
         potentials of materials to new, startling, and very compelling

         districts of thought, expression, memory. As in your explication
         with the mystery text in our studioclass: how things are laid
         bare, sequenced, convoluted, twisted, enmeshed on the page; that
         is, to take form as thought itself becoming thought or to follow
         the itinerary of a thought or expression, the trajectory of it,
         and its collision and relation with others. Composition, indeed.
         Music, indeed. Great work this term!
